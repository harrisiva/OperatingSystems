$ indicates a command line prompt. Do not copy it when running the following material.

To rename makefile.mk to makefile, run:

$mv makefile.a4 makefile

Place makefile is in the same folder where your all .c files (named as mentioned in the assignment description) are and to compile run:

$ make

This will compile your all c programs in same folder for Question 1 and Question 2. If you want to run Question 1 the use:
$ make runq1

For question 2, run:

$ make runq2

To clean out the directory, you can use:

$make clean

Some notes are already posted in previous lectures on Makefiles, In addition https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Introduction.html has a decent reference on make files.
